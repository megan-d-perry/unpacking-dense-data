# unpacking-dense-data
efficient cleaning of records from data scrapes

When dealing with messy, dense data from a web scrape, splitting and concatenating can be particularly useful for 
separating data into individual columns, combining multiple columns, and removing unwanted characters or substrings.

Here, I have used those methods to flatten dense, messy data. The data was initially in just two columns, but
needed many more specific columns. Read on for an efficient way to achieve the same!

I've included a sample of redacted data and a sample of how the data should look afterwords. I reccomend that you make a copy of the redacted data and go through the processes described, until you have something that looks like the "flattened" data example.

Thanks!

Updated to include annotated, step by step process.
